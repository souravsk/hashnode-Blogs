Hey Everyone in today's blog we will learn about Linux and how it is a very important DevOps Engineer. So let go and learn

# What is Linux?

Linux is a free, open-source operating system, released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code, or even sell copies of their modified code, as long as they do so under the same license.

Linux has become the largest open sources software project in the world. Professional and hobbyist programmers and developers from around the world contribute to the Linux kernel, adding features, finding and fixing bugs and security flaws, live patching, and providing new ideas‚Äîall while sharing their contributions back to the community.

Linux was designed to be similar to UNIX but has evolved to run on a wide variety of hardware from phones to supercomputers. Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel‚Äîwhich manages hardware resources‚Äîand a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system. Organizations can also choose to run their Linux OS on a Linux server.

The OS includes some common core components, like the GNU tools, among others.¬†These tools give the user a way to manage the resources provided by the kernel, install additional software, configure performance and security settings, and more. All of these tools bundled together make up the functional operating system. Because Linux is an open-source OS, combinations of software can vary between Linux distributions.

# Linux for DevOps

A lot of people now think of the **technical term** ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù as just a catch-all for those tasks which create infrastructure, build software, and get it running in production.

But what exactly are those tasks?

Let‚Äôs talk

If you‚Äôre going to be doing DevOps, in a company that uses Linux to run applications and servers, then you‚Äôll probably need to know how to use a Linux terminal üêßüíª, and know the top Linux commands so that you can do things like these:

* **Creating and editing files**
    
* **Running programs**
    
* **Managing users, groups and permissions**
    
* **Understanding where programs and system files are kept** ‚Äì this is sometimes called the **Linux directory structure**
    
* **Configuring network connections and firewalls**
    
* **Installing and configuring software** ‚Äì usually called **packages** in Linux
    
* **Building and compiling software** ‚Äì for example, how to build Java, C or JavaScript programs
    
* **Monitoring programs and processes** ‚Äì e.g. using the command top
    
* **Automating all of the things above** ‚Äì using simple scripting like Bash
    

This isn‚Äôt an exhaustive list, by the way!

There are some more specialized tasks that a DevOps-skilled engineer might occasionally need to do.

But, these are at least the basic tasks that are involved in deploying software.

This might sound like a lot to learn, but you can pick up these skills step-by-step.

## Is it hard to learn Linux?

It‚Äôs not difficult to learn Linux basics, like logging on to a server, creating and editing files.

And to be honest, that‚Äôs good enough for everyday knowledge.

If you‚Äôre chasing Linux , then it could take years to become an expert.

So you might find it easier if you have a natural level of ‚Äúcuriosity‚Äù towards Linux. For example, you‚Äôll often ask questions like:

* *What does \[x\] command do?*
    
* *Where can I configure this program?*
    
* *Why is this program not working?*
    

Since Linux (or GNU/Linux) is made up of a whole heap of different programs and utilities, you often have to spend time finding the utility which does the job that you want, and then you need to find the focus to read and understand documentation. That‚Äôs where your natural curiosity will help.

But every time you learn something new, your knowledge will grow.

Now we‚Äôve seen a bit about using Linux for DevOps, let‚Äôs look into the distributions you might see at work.

# The End

That's all for today these are not the only thing that you do with Linux the more you use the more you will learn to use and get curious to know about it.
