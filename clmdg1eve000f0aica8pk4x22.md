Hey everyone in our blog we are going learn about what Kubernetes is. Why do we need Kubernetes and how does it even work? So let's go and learn about Kubernetes which is the most treading tope in cloud and DevOps.

But before we go on to learn what is Kubernetes I hope you know what is container. If not then don't worry [Click here](https://souravk.hashnode.dev/containers-and-docker-simplifying-application-deployment) to learn about container and docker.

So when we run multiple containers for an application we need to manage those containers to do so we have Kubernetes.

# What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is like a powerful conductor for managing and orchestrating a group of containers. Imagine you have a bunch of containers, which are like small, self-contained packages of software and all the things they need to run. Kubernetes helps you organize and control these containers, making sure they run smoothly, scale when needed, and stay healthy, just like a conductor manages an orchestra to play harmoniously. It automates tasks like deploying, scaling, and maintaining these containers, making it easier to manage complex applications in the world of cloud computing.

In simpler terms, think of Kubernetes as a smart traffic police for your containers, directing them to the right place, ensuring they communicate effectively, and handling any issues that may arise. It allows you to focus on developing your applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to build and run software in the modern digital landscape.

# Why We Need It

We need Kubernetes because it simplifies and streamlines the management of complex applications. Without it, handling many containers and making sure they run reliably and scale up or down as needed would be like trying to juggle too many balls at once. Kubernetes makes this task much easier by automating these processes, reducing downtime, and improving the overall efficiency and stability of our applications, ultimately saving time and resources.

1. **Efficiency:** Kubernetes helps us make the most of our computing resources by efficiently distributing workloads across servers, ensuring that they are used effectively. This means we get more bang for our buck when it comes to server utilization.
    
2. **Scalability:** As our applications grow, we can easily scale them up (or down) with Kubernetes. It's like adding or removing seats at a restaurant table based on the number of guests â€“ we can accommodate more users without a lot of manual effort.
    
3. **Resilience:** Kubernetes keeps our applications running, even if some parts fail. It automatically replaces failed containers or servers, reducing downtime and ensuring a more reliable user experience.
    
4. **Consistency:** It enforces consistency in our deployment processes, making it easier to move applications between different environments, such as from a developer's laptop to a production server.
    
5. **Portability:** Kubernetes works across various cloud providers and on-premises environments, giving us flexibility in where and how we run our applications. This means we're not locked into a specific vendor.
    

In summary, Kubernetes simplifies, automates, and improves the management of our applications, making them more efficient, resilient, and adaptable in today's dynamic IT landscape.

# How it works

At its core, Kubernetes works like a smart manager for containers. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. **Desired State**: You tell Kubernetes what you want your application to look like - how many containers, what kind of resources they need, and how they should work together. This is like giving instructions to set up a specific LEGO structure.
    
2. **Controllers**: Kubernetes has controllers that continuously check your application's actual state against the desired state. If there are any differences (like a container crashing), Kubernetes takes action to fix it, just like a manager ensuring things are on track.
    
3. **Nodes**: Kubernetes manages a group of machines called "nodes" (servers or virtual machines). It decides which nodes should run your containers and handles the distribution. Think of this as assigning tasks to employees based on their skills.
    
4. **Scaling**: If your application gets more traffic, Kubernetes can automatically create more copies of your containers to handle the load. It's like hiring more workers when a store gets busier.
    
5. **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes can distribute incoming requests evenly among your containers, like a traffic cop directing cars to different lanes on a highway to avoid congestion.
    
6. **Rollouts and Rollbacks**: When you update your application, Kubernetes can roll out the changes gradually and roll back if something goes wrong, like an undo button for software updates.

In a nutshell, Kubernetes acts as an automated manager for your containers, making sure they run as you want, fixing issues, and adapting to changes, all while running on a group of machines called nodes. This helps keep your applications running smoothly and reliably.

We will learn about every component of Kubernetes in our later blogs.

# THE END

That's all for today in my next blog we are going to install Minikube in our local host so that we can practice docker. We will learn about Minikube.
