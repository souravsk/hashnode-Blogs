I recently attended my first meetup on WebAssembly and Fermyon at Infosys's big and beautiful campus in Pune. There were about 40+ people in attendance, including both experienced WebAssembly users and those who were new to it. The event was hosted by Infosys and featured presentations by the CEO and CTO of Fermyon, Matt Butcher and Radu Matei.

The presentation by Matt Butcher and Radu Matei started with an overview of WebAssembly and Fermyon. They discussed the benefits of using WebAssembly, such as its ability to run code in any web browser and its potential to improve performance. They also talked about some of the challenges of using WebAssembly, such as its lack of support for some features of traditional programming languages.

After the presentation, there was a Q&A session. I asked a question about how to use WebAssembly to create a cross-platform application. The speakers gave me some tips on how to use WebAssembly to create a web application that can be run in any web browser.

The meetup ended with a networking session. I had a chance to talk to some of the other attendees and learn more about their experiences with WebAssembly and Fermyon. I also made some new connections with other developers who are interested in these technologies.

Overall, I had a great time at my first meetup on WebAssembly and Fermyon. I learned a lot about these powerful technologies and met some great people. I would definitely recommend attending a meetup on WebAssembly and Fermyon if you are interested in learning more about these technologies I also go a T-shirt which was really cool and nice.

**Here are some of the things I learned at the meetup:**

* WebAssembly is a new technology that allows code to be compiled to run in any web browser.
    
* Fermyon is a company that is building a platform for developing and running WebAssembly applications.
    
* Fermyon's platform has the potential to improve the performance, portability, and security of WebAssembly applications.
    
* Fermyon is still in the early stages of development, but it has the potential to be a major player in the WebAssembly space.
    

If you're interested in learning more about WebAssembly and Fermyon, you go to [https://www.fermyon.com](https://www.fermyon.com)

Here are some of the things that make Fermyon awesome:

* It's a new technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we develop and run applications.
    
* It's backed by a team of experienced engineers who are passionate about making WebAssembly a success.
    
* It's open source, so anyone can contribute to its development.
    
* It's still in the early stages, so there's a lot of potential for innovation.
    

I'm excited to see what the future holds for Fermyon and WebAssembly. I believe these technologies have the potential to change the way we build and interact with software.

**Special Thanks**

I would like to thank Infosys for hosting the meetup and Matt Butcher and Radu Matei for giving such informative presentations. I would also like to thank the other attendees for making it such a great event.
