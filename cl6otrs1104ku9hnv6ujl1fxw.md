## Getting Started with GitHub

Hey Everyone, this blog is on Github an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. my last blog is on [Git Version Control](https://souravk.hashnode.dev/git-version-control) if you haven't read it, please go and read that and then come back for this blog.

## What is GitHub?
We may infer from the name that it is a Hub with initiatives, communities, etc. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories that offers a web-based graphical user interface. It is the world's biggest community. When a project is open-source, its specific repository is made public and receives numerous contributions.

We can access Github central repository via HTTPS or SSH.

The key benefits of GitHub are as follows:


- It is easy to contribute to open-source projects via GitHub.
- It helps to create an excellent document.
- You can attract a recruiter by showing off your work. If you have a profile on GitHub, you will have a higher chance of being recruited.
- It allows your work to get out there in front of the public.
- You can track changes in your code across versions.

## Creating A GitHub Account
Hop on to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create your own GitHub account that you will use to create remote repositories and get started with your Open - Source Journey.

> TipðŸ’¡- If you're a student, do consider getting a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which provides you with different tools and resources to head start your tech journey.

- Step 3:- 
Connecting your local repository to a remote repository

The GitHub repository we have created is empty, we have to upload our project into it. To do this we have to connect our remote repo(called origin) with our local repo. To do this, we need to copy the remote repo link.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/souravsk/demo.git
``` 


To check if the remote is added successfully or not use the following command

```
git remote -v
``` 

- Step 4 :- 
Now add files to your local repository folder which you just created after that we will add to the repository by using git commands

```
git add .
``` 
" . " This means it will add all files and folder init.


- Step 5:- 
Now after adding all the files we will commit it by using the git command.

```
git commit -m " First Commit"
``` 
`-m` it is used for the message. 

- Step 6:- 
Now, it's time to push our code which will send the local commits to the remote branch of the repository.

```
git push origin main
``` 
Now, once you go to your remote repository and refresh the page you will see that the code is uploaded on GitHub.

## Conclusion
Now You can create awesome projects and share them with everyone and if your project is good then people will also contribute to your project.
